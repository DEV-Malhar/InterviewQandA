In .NET, helpers are utility classes or methods that provide common functionality and help developers write cleaner, more maintainable code. Helpers can be used across an application to perform tasks such as string manipulation, date formatting, or generating HTML markup. 

Here are some common types of helpers in .NET:

1. **String Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for common string operations such as concatenation, trimming, formatting, and parsing.

2. **DateTime Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for working with dates and times, such as formatting dates, calculating date differences, and parsing date strings.

3. **File Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for working with files, such as reading and writing files, checking file existence, and manipulating file paths.

4. **HTML Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for generating HTML markup, such as creating form controls, generating links, and rendering partial views.

5. **Validation Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for validating data, such as checking for required fields, validating email addresses, and enforcing data formats.

6. **Serialization Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for serializing and deserializing objects, such as converting objects to JSON or XML format.

7. **Caching Helpers:** These helpers provide methods for caching data, such as storing frequently accessed data in memory or on disk to improve performance.

Helpers can be implemented as static classes with static methods or as extension methods on existing classes. They are typically used to encapsulate common functionality and reduce code duplication in an application.
