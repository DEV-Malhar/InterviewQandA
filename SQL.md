****SQL Question Answer****
Here are 10 SQL interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is a primary key, and why is it important in a database?**
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It is important because it ensures that each record in the table is uniquely identified, which helps maintain data integrity and enables efficient data retrieval.

2. **Explain the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index.**
   - A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index does not. Each table can have only one clustered index, which defines the order of the table's rows. Non-clustered indexes are stored separately from the data and can be created on multiple columns.

3. **What is a foreign key, and how is it used in relational databases?**
   - A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring referential integrity. Foreign keys are used to enforce constraints and maintain data consistency.

4. **What is the difference between a left join and an inner join?**
   - An inner join returns rows from both tables that have matching values based on the join condition. A left join returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table, with unmatched rows in the right table having NULL values.

5. **Explain the ACID properties of database transactions.**
   - ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, Consistency ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction, Isolation ensures that the transaction is isolated from other transactions, and Durability ensures that the changes made by a transaction are permanent and survive system failures.

6. **What is a view in SQL, and how is it used?**
   - A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL statement. It is used to simplify complex queries, hide the complexity of the underlying data structure, and provide a layer of security by limiting access to certain columns or rows of a table.

7. **What is a stored procedure, and why would you use it?**
   - A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements that perform a specific task. It is stored in the database and can be executed multiple times without the need to recompile. Stored procedures are used to improve performance, reduce network traffic, and enforce security by controlling access to the database.

8. **How do you optimize SQL queries for better performance?**
   - Some ways to optimize SQL queries include using indexes to speed up data retrieval, minimizing the use of expensive operations like joins and subqueries, avoiding unnecessary columns in the result set, and using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

9. **What is a transaction log, and how is it used in database management?**
   - A transaction log is a file that records all changes made to the database. It is used to ensure the durability of transactions by providing a record of all committed transactions that can be used to recover the database in the event of a system failure.

10. **Explain the difference between a SQL function and a stored procedure.**
    - A SQL function returns a value and can be used in SQL statements, while a stored procedure performs an action and can contain multiple SQL statements. Functions are typically used for calculations and data manipulation, while stored procedures are used for tasks that involve multiple operations or complex logic.

Certainly! Here are 10 SQL technical interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is normalization in databases, and why is it important?**
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. It helps improve data integrity, minimize storage space, and simplify database maintenance.

2. **Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.**
   - SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables and use structured query language (SQL) to manipulate data. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats like JSON and use query languages specific to the database type. NoSQL databases are often used for big data and real-time applications.

3. **What is an index in a database, and how does it improve query performance?**
   - An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like an index in a book, allowing the database to quickly locate rows based on the indexed columns. Indexes can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter, sort, or group data.

4. **Explain the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index.**
   - A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index does not. Each table can have only one clustered index, which defines the order of the table's rows. Non-clustered indexes are stored separately from the data and can be created on multiple columns.

5. **What is a SQL join, and what are the different types of joins?**
   - A SQL join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The main types of joins are INNER JOIN (returns rows when there is a match in both tables), LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table), and RIGHT JOIN (returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table).

6. **How do you handle NULL values in SQL queries?**
   - NULL values in SQL represent missing or unknown data. You can handle NULL values in SQL queries using functions like IS NULL (checks if a value is NULL), IS NOT NULL (checks if a value is not NULL), and COALESCE (returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions).

7. **What is a SQL subquery, and how is it used?**
   - A SQL subquery is a query nested inside another query (the outer query). It is used to return data that is used in the main query as a condition or value. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to perform complex queries.

8. **Explain the difference between the SQL statements DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP.**
   - DELETE is used to remove rows from a table based on a condition, while TRUNCATE is used to remove all rows from a table (but retains the table structure). DROP is used to remove an entire table, including its structure, from the database.

9. **What is a SQL view, and how is it used?**
   - A SQL view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL statement. It is used to simplify complex queries, hide the complexity of the underlying data structure, and provide a layer of security by limiting access to certain columns or rows of a table.

10. **How do you optimize SQL queries for better performance?**
    - Some ways to optimize SQL queries include using indexes to speed up data retrieval, minimizing the use of expensive operations like joins and subqueries, avoiding unnecessary columns in the result set, and using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
