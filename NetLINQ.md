Here are some common LINQ (Language Integrated Query) interview questions along with sample answers for someone with experience in .NET development:

1. **What is LINQ?**
   - LINQ is a set of extensions to the .NET languages (C# and VB.NET) that provides a unified way to query data from different data sources, such as collections, databases, and XML files, using a syntax similar to SQL.

2. **What are the main advantages of using LINQ?**
   - LINQ provides a more readable and concise syntax for querying data compared to traditional loop-based approaches.
   - LINQ queries are type-safe, which helps catch errors at compile time.
   - LINQ allows for easier manipulation and transformation of data.
   - LINQ queries can be used with different data sources without changing the query syntax.

3. **What are the different LINQ operators?**
   - LINQ provides a set of standard query operators that can be used to query, filter, sort, group, and manipulate data. Some common operators include `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`, `Join`, and `Aggregate`.

4. **How do you use LINQ to query a collection of objects?**
   - You can use the `from` keyword followed by a range variable, the `in` keyword, and a collection to query a collection of objects. For example:
     ```csharp
     var query = from person in people
                 where person.Age > 30
                 select person.Name;
     ```

5. **How do you use LINQ to query a database using Entity Framework?**
   - You can use LINQ to query a database using Entity Framework by creating a `DbContext` class that represents the database and defining `DbSet` properties for each entity. Then, you can write LINQ queries against these `DbSet` properties to query the database. For example:
     ```csharp
     var query = from product in dbContext.Products
                 where product.Category == "Electronics"
                 select product;
     ```

6. **What is deferred execution in LINQ?**
   - Deferred execution means that LINQ queries are not executed immediately when they are defined, but rather when the query results are actually enumerated. 
   - This allows for optimization and lazy loading of data.

7. **How do you force immediate execution of a LINQ query?**
   - You can force immediate execution of a LINQ query by calling methods like `ToList`, `ToArray`, `ToDictionary`, or `FirstOrDefault` on the query result. 
   - These methods enumerate the query results and execute the query immediately.

8. **What is the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in LINQ?**
   - `IEnumerable` is the base interface for all LINQ queries and represents a sequence of objects that can be enumerated. `
   - IQueryable` inherits from `IEnumerable` and represents a query that can be executed against a specific data source, such as a database. `IQueryable` allows for more complex query translation and optimization.

9. **How do you handle exceptions in LINQ queries?**
   - Exceptions in LINQ queries can be handled using standard exception handling techniques, such as `try-catch` blocks. Additionally, you can use methods like `FirstOrDefault`, `SingleOrDefault`, `First`, or `Single`, which throw exceptions if the query returns no results or multiple results.

10. **Can you use LINQ to query non-generic collections?**
    - Yes, LINQ can be used to query non-generic collections by using the `Cast` or `OfType` operators to convert the non-generic collection to a generic collection before querying it. For example:
      ```csharp
      var query = from object in nonGenericCollection.Cast<int>()
                  where object > 0
                  select object;
      ```

These answers should help you prepare for a LINQ interview and demonstrate your expertise in using LINQ in .NET development.
