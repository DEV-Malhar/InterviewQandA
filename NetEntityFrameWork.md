****.Net Core Entity Framework Interview Questions Answer****

Here are 10 Entity Framework Core interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is Entity Framework (EF) Core, and how does it differ from previous versions of Entity Framework?**
   - Entity Framework Core is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET Core applications. 
   - It differs from previous versions of Entity Framework in that it is lightweight, extensible, and designed to work with .NET Core, including support for cross-platform development.

2. **Explain the DbContext class in Entity Framework Core and its role in database operations.**
   - The DbContext class in Entity Framework Core represents a session with the database and is used to query and save data to the database. 
   - It manages the entity classes (represented as DbSet properties) and provides methods for querying and saving data.

3. **How do you define entity classes and relationships in Entity Framework Core?**
   - Entity classes in Entity Framework Core are defined as regular C# classes with properties that map to database columns. 
   - Relationships between entities are defined using navigation properties, which are properties that reference other entities. 
   - Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, and are configured using attributes or Fluent API.

4. **What are migrations in Entity Framework Core, and how do you use them to manage database schema changes?**
   - Migrations in Entity Framework Core are used to manage database schema changes over time. 
   - They allow you to create and apply incremental changes to the database schema based on changes to your entity classes. 
   - You can create migrations using the `dotnet ef migrations add` command and apply migrations using the `dotnet ef database update` command.

5. **Explain the concept of lazy loading in Entity Framework Core and how you would configure it.**
   - Lazy loading in Entity Framework Core is a feature that allows related entities to be automatically loaded from the database when they are accessed. 
   - To enable lazy loading, you need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies` package and configure your DbContext to use proxy classes. 
   - Lazy loading can help improve performance by only loading related entities when they are needed.

6. **How do you handle complex queries in Entity Framework Core, such as joins and aggregations?**
   - In Entity Framework Core, you can use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to write complex queries that involve joins, aggregations, and other operations. 
   - LINQ queries are translated into SQL queries by Entity Framework Core and executed against the database. 
   - You can also use raw SQL queries or stored procedures for complex queries if needed.

7. **What are database migrations and how do you handle them in Entity Framework Core?**
   - Database migrations in Entity Framework Core are a way to manage changes to the database schema over time. 
   - Migrations allow you to update the database schema based on changes to your entity classes. 
   - You can create migrations using the `Add-Migration` command in the Package Manager Console or using the `dotnet ef migrations add` command in the .NET CLI.

8. **How do you handle concurrency in Entity Framework Core to prevent data conflicts?**
   - In Entity Framework Core, you can handle concurrency by using the `ConcurrencyCheck` attribute on properties that should be checked for concurrency conflicts.
   -  When updating an entity, Entity Framework Core will check if the value of the property has changed since it was last read from the database and throw a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` if a conflict is detected.

9. **What are some performance tuning techniques you can use in Entity Framework Core?**
   - Some performance tuning techniques for Entity Framework Core include using eager loading (`Include` method) to load related entities in a single query, using explicit loading (`Load` method) to selectively load related entities, using indexes and query optimization techniques in the database, and minimizing the use of lazy loading for performance-critical operations.

10. **How do you handle transactions in Entity Framework Core to ensure data consistency?**
    - In Entity Framework Core, you can use transactions to ensure that a group of database operations is performed atomically (i.e., all or none of the operations succeed). 
    - You can use the `Transaction` class to begin, commit, or rollback transactions in Entity Framework Core. 
    - Transactions are typically used when you need to perform multiple operations that depend on each other and must be completed together.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<----------------------Technical Q&A---------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Here are 10 technical Entity Framework Core interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is the difference between EF Core and EF 6 (Entity Framework 6)?**
   - EF Core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework, designed to work with .NET Core. EF Core is a complete rewrite of Entity Framework and has some differences in features and APIs compared to EF 6.

2. **How does Entity Framework Core handle database providers, and which providers have you used?**
   - Entity Framework Core uses database providers to interact with different database systems (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite). You can configure the database provider in the `Startup` class or `DbContext` options. 
   - I have used providers like 
       - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, 
       - Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL, and 
       - Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql.

3. **Explain the concept of migrations in Entity Framework Core and how you would create and apply them.**
   - Migrations in Entity Framework Core are used to manage database schema changes over time. 
   - You can create migrations using the `Add-Migration` command in the Package Manager Console or `dotnet ef migrations add` command in the .NET CLI.
   -  You can apply migrations using the `Update-Database` command or `dotnet ef database update` command.

4. **How do you configure relationships between entities in Entity Framework Core, and what are the different types of relationships?**
   - Relationships between entities in Entity Framework Core are configured using navigation properties and the Fluent API. 
   - Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. 
   - You can configure relationships using methods like `HasOne`, `WithMany`, `HasForeignKey`, `HasPrincipalKey`, etc., in the `OnModelCreating` method of your `DbContext` class.

5. **What is the purpose of the `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core, and how do you use it in your applications?**
   - The `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core represents a session with the database and is used to query and save data to the database.
   -  You can create a custom `DbContext` class that derives from `DbContext` and defines `DbSet` properties for each entity in your application. 
   -  You can then use the `DbContext` class to perform database operations.

6. **How do you handle concurrency in Entity Framework Core to prevent conflicts when multiple users are updating the same entity?**
   - Entity Framework Core provides optimistic concurrency control, where it checks if the entity has been modified by another user since it was last read from the database. 
   - If a conflict is detected, Entity Framework Core throws a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`, and you can handle the conflict by reloading the entity and applying the changes.

7. **What are shadow properties in Entity Framework Core, and how do you use them?**
   - Shadow properties in Entity Framework Core are properties that are not defined in your entity classes but are used to store additional data in the database. 
   - You can use shadow properties to store metadata or audit information about entities. 
   - Shadow properties are configured using the `Property` method in the `OnModelCreating` method of your `DbContext` class.

8. **How do you handle transactions in Entity Framework Core to ensure data consistency?**
   - Entity Framework Core allows you to use transactions to ensure that a group of database operations is performed atomically. 
   - You can use the `Transaction` class to begin, commit, or rollback transactions in Entity Framework Core. 
   - Transactions are typically used when you need to perform multiple operations that depend on each other and must be completed together.

9. **Explain the concept of eager loading, lazy loading, and explicit loading in Entity Framework Core.**
   - Eager loading is a technique in Entity Framework Core where related entities are loaded from the database along with the main entity. 
   - Lazy loading is a technique where related entities are loaded from the database only when they are accessed. 
   - Explicit loading is a technique where related entities are loaded from the database explicitly using the `Load` method.

10. **How do you write raw SQL queries in Entity Framework Core, and when would you use them?**
    - Entity Framework Core allows you to write raw SQL queries using the `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` methods. 
    - You would use raw SQL queries when you need to perform complex queries that cannot be expressed using LINQ or when you need to leverage database-specific features or optimizations.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< .Net Razor Framework     >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Blazor is a framework for building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It allows developers to use C# and Razor syntax to create web pages and components that run in the browser using WebAssembly. Blazor can be used to create single-page applications (SPAs) or to add interactive components to existing ASP.NET Core applications.

Here are some key features of ASP.NET Core Blazor:

1. **Razor Components:** Blazor uses Razor Components, which are reusable UI elements that can contain both HTML and C# code. Razor Components can be used to build complex UIs with rich functionality.

2. **Component-based Architecture:** Blazor follows a component-based architecture, similar to popular front-end frameworks like React and Angular. Components can be nested and composed to create complex UIs.

3. **Two Hosting Models:** Blazor supports two hosting models: client-side and server-side. In the client-side model, the entire Blazor application is downloaded to the client and runs in the browser using WebAssembly. In the server-side model, the UI logic runs on the server and updates are sent to the client using SignalR.

4. **Integration with ASP.NET Core:** Blazor integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core, allowing you to use existing ASP.NET Core features and middleware in your Blazor applications.

5. **Cross-platform Development:** Since Blazor applications run in the browser, they can be developed and deployed on any platform that supports modern web browsers.

6. **Rich Ecosystem:** Blazor has a growing ecosystem of third-party libraries and components that can be used to extend its functionality and speed up development.

Overall, ASP.NET Core Blazor provides a modern and productive framework for building interactive web UIs using C# and .NET. It's a great choice for developers familiar with .NET who want to leverage their existing skills to build web applications.
