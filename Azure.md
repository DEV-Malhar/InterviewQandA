Here are 10 Azure technical interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is Azure and how does it differ from other cloud providers?**
   - Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. It offers a wide range of cloud services, including virtual machines, app services, storage, and databases. Azure differs from other cloud providers in its integration with Microsoft products and services, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, and Active Directory.

2. **Explain the Azure Service Model.**
   - The Azure Service Model is a set of guidelines and best practices for designing and deploying applications on Azure. It includes concepts like Resource Groups, Resources, Subscriptions, and Management Groups, which help organize and manage resources in Azure.

3. **What is Azure App Service and how does it simplify web application deployment?**
   - Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that allows you to build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs. It simplifies web application deployment by providing built-in features for deployment slots, auto-scaling, continuous deployment, and integration with Azure DevOps.

4. **How do you ensure security in Azure?**
   - Security in Azure can be ensured through various measures, including network security groups (NSGs), Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), encryption at rest and in transit, and regular security audits and assessments.

5. **What are Azure Functions and how are they used?**
   - Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. It is used for tasks like data processing, file processing, and integrating with other Azure services or third-party services.

6. **Explain the difference between Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB.**
   - Azure SQL Database is a relational database service based on SQL Server, while Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service designed for scalable and high-performance applications. Azure SQL Database is best suited for traditional relational database applications, while Azure Cosmos DB is ideal for applications requiring high scalability and low latency.

7. **How do you monitor and manage Azure resources?**
   - Azure provides various tools and services for monitoring and managing resources, including `Azure Monitor, Azure Resource Manager, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure Portal`. These tools allow you to monitor resource usage, set up alerts, and manage resources programmatically.

8. **What is Azure DevOps and how is it used in the development lifecycle?**
   - Azure DevOps is a set of tools and services for managing the software development lifecycle. It includes features for version control, build automation, release management, and project tracking. Azure DevOps is used to streamline and automate the development process, from code commit to deployment.

9. **How do you ensure high availability and disaster recovery in Azure?**
   - High availability in Azure can be ensured through features like Azure Availability Zones, which provide redundant infrastructure across multiple data centers. Disaster recovery can be achieved through Azure Site Recovery, which replicates workloads to a secondary location for failover in case of a disaster.

10. **How do you scale applications in Azure?**
    - Applications in Azure can be scaled vertically (scale up) by increasing the size of the virtual machine or horizontally (scale out) by adding more instances of the application. Azure also provides auto-scaling features that automatically adjust resources based on demand.

These answers should help you prepare for a technical Azure interview and demonstrate your expertise with 3 years of developer experience.

Here are 10 Azure .NET technical interview questions along with sample answers for someone with 3 years of developer experience:

1. **What is Azure App Service and how can you deploy a .NET application to it?**
   - Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. You can deploy a .NET application to Azure App Service using tools like Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, or the Azure Portal. Visual Studio provides seamless integration with Azure for deploying web applications directly from the IDE.

2. **How do you handle configuration and secrets in a .NET application deployed to Azure?**
   - Configuration and secrets in a .NET application deployed to Azure can be managed using Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault allows you to store and access secrets, certificates, and keys securely. You can use the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault` package to access Key Vault secrets in your .NET application.

3. **Explain the difference between Azure Blob Storage and Azure File Storage.**
   - Azure Blob Storage is used to store unstructured data, such as images, videos, and documents, in the cloud. Azure File Storage, on the other hand, provides shared file storage that can be accessed from multiple virtual machines or services using the SMB protocol.

4. **How do you secure a .NET application deployed to Azure?**
   - You can secure a .NET application deployed to Azure using Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication and authorization. AAD allows you to authenticate users and control access to your application based on their identity. You can also use Azure App Service Authentication to integrate AAD authentication into your application.

5. **What is Azure SQL Database and how does it differ from SQL Server?**
   - Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service in Azure that is based on SQL Server. It differs from SQL Server in that it is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering, meaning that Microsoft manages the infrastructure, patching, and backups for you. Azure SQL Database also provides built-in high availability and scalability features.

6. **How can you monitor the performance of a .NET application deployed to Azure?**
   - You can monitor the performance of a .NET application deployed to Azure using Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor provides monitoring and diagnostics for applications deployed to Azure, including metrics, logs, and alerts. You can use Azure Application Insights to monitor the performance of your application and identify issues.

7. **What is Azure Functions and how can you use it with a .NET application?**
   - Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code in Azure. You can use Azure Functions with a .NET application to create serverless APIs, process data, and respond to events. Azure Functions supports .NET Core, so you can write functions using C#.

8. **How do you scale a .NET application deployed to Azure?**
   - You can scale a .NET application deployed to Azure vertically (scale up) by increasing the size of the virtual machine or horizontally (scale out) by adding more instances of the application. Azure App Service also provides auto-scaling features that allow you to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

9. **What is Azure DevOps and how can you use it with a .NET application?**
   - Azure DevOps is a set of tools and services for managing the software development lifecycle. You can use Azure DevOps with a .NET application to automate build and release pipelines, manage source code with Git, and track work items and project progress. Azure DevOps provides integration with Visual Studio and Azure for seamless development and deployment.

10. **How do you deploy a .NET application to Azure using Azure DevOps?**
    - You can deploy a .NET application to Azure using Azure DevOps by creating a build pipeline and a release pipeline. The build pipeline compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application for deployment. The release pipeline deploys the application to Azure using a deployment task specific to the Azure service you are deploying to.

These answers should help you prepare for a technical Azure .NET interview and demonstrate your expertise with 3 years of developer experience.
